            <p class="lead">There is no such thing as time. Time, the dimension doesn’t exist. It’s all a matter of perception. 

Activities. Billions of billions of billons of activities are happening right now. Everything is connected. An activity performed by someone in Delhi is indirectly connected with another person doing another activity sitting at a casino in Las Vegas. Sounds crazy? It is. 
Suppose a person got seriously injured in a car crash (say in location A). That might be because of a door bell rang at a house (at location B). This is how. 
The person was chatting with her girlfriend a while ago. He had to go to a store to grab some foods and he texted her goodbye and waited for a reply. Meanwhile, the girl’s doorbell rang (someone came). So she went down to open the door and came back in a while and then replied his man. After that he left (around 3 minutes late from his ideal departure time in case the doorbell hadn’t rung and had she replied back instantly). The car crash wouldn’t have occurred if he was 3 minutes early, because the truck he crashed with wasn’t present at that location 3 minutes ago). You may call this ‘the Activity chain’.
Now the contradiction might be visible. Earlier I said time doesn’t exist. And now I’m especially emphasizing on time. Well, time does exist. But not as a dimension. It exists as a perception. 
Let me get straight in. You can imagine time as a stack. A stack that contains billions of billions of sets of activities. And each activity set consists of billions of billions of activities. The numbers of activities are finite, though. That person who met a car crash wasn’t 3 minute late, his activity ‘departure’ was just rescheduled and got prioritized down. Millions of other activities came in in between the ‘departure’. He wasn’t late by time. His activity was delayed. 
Let’s now try to explain a girl holding a glass of water in hand for five minutes in terms of activity. It’s not time. It’s activity length. The activity is X units long (equivalent to what we say 5 minutes). Soon after the activity is finished, a new activity will take place as scheduled.
So who schedules this activities?
Actually it’s all scheduled when the Big Bang occurred. Mother of all activities is Big Bang. As the explosion occurred, it triggered all the activities happening today. The explosion occurred, it triggered innumerable number of activities. Those activities then triggered some more activities. And it went on, and still going on. Like I said, all activities in this world are connected and every activity is an effect of some other activity (cause). You’re reading this article, it’s because of big bang (connected in a really very long activity chain). And that brings us to another great point – every activity chain happening today is a subset of that big activity chain (the Big Bang one).
Another thing must be explained. When there’s no activity, the stack (time) is empty and hence doesn’t exist. Before big bang there was no activity. The very first activity of this universe was big bang. So before big bang, the stack was null. Which is why it is said that time begun with big bang.  
That brings us  to the most important question ever. Who triggered the activity of Big Bang? No one knows.
